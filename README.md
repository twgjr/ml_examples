# Introduction
The goal of this repository is to act as a reference for working machine learning algorithms.  This collection of projects demonstrates the use of popular machine learning frameworks to solve basic, but interesting problems.  They are generally not complete production ready projects, which would have their own dedicated repository.

Projects may include:

* "Hello World" examples to check that a framework is working
* Learning by exploring interesting datasets and algorithms
* Custom implementations of algorithms ported from other frameworks
* Coding algorithms from scratch with libraries such as numpy
* Coding ML papers from scratch within a ML framework
* Usage of data analysis and visualization tools
* Usage of ML pipelines

Most of the source code is python and jupyter notebooks.  Anaconda and Visual Studio Code are the preferred development environments.  Anaconda for package and environment management.  Visual Studio Code for the IDE.

# Getting Started
Jupiter notebooks are the main interface for all the projects. To get them running:
1. Install Anaconda and VS Code
1. Choose an example jupyter notebook to run.
1. Use Anaconda to install any required packages listed in the imports of a notebook.

Some of the most common packages imported are:

```
numpy
matplotlib
pandas
seaborn
sklearn
torch
tensorflow
```

# Learning Machine Learning
Here is list of some resources that have been helpful in learning machine learning:

1. Machine Learning Specialization by DeepLearning.ai on Coursera
2. Deep Learning Specialization by DeepLearning.ai on Coursera
3. Practical tutorials on Kaggle. (+ML competitions are a great way to test your skills)
